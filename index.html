      Fred Stevens-Smith:
  😟
  well you live and learn. and next time you’ll make the big moneys 😊
  i love working late when everyone has gone home
  it’s such a productive time
Sarah Kim:
  Wish I could do that with you! 
  When I get paid at the end of the month we are going to Tahoe 
  I just made that decision for both of us 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  come and do it
  I’m in. i like it when you make decisions.
Sarah Kim:
  I totally would but I need a light kit, a camera, and a backdrop 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  hehe
  how’s the video going?
  yo i’m heading home
  want a quick break or are you soldiering thru
Sarah Kim:
  Aww are you already at home? 
  Just saw this :(
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  No just leaving 
Sarah Kim:
  Were you going to stop by?
  I'm so hungry :(
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Yeah unless I'm distracting you lovely 
  Want me to pick you something up?
Sarah Kim:

You've seen this right? 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yeeeeey
  I’m proud of you 😊
  what did they say? was it for the video stuff?
  ahhhh OC 💖💖💖
Sarah Kim:
  Yeah, I just got really great feedback from it. My instructor said that it seems like I inadvertently make feminist statements in my work for this class because I am so passionate about that and that shows through. He encouraged me to keep pushing that instead of trying to shy away from it and that "this is really going to go somewhere" 
  Yayyyy
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yaaaaaaay!
  that’s great
  that feeling of being on a high when you get a win is so amazing isn’t it? i’m kind of there right now too, just had 2 amazing sales calls, one where we’d been recommended by ‘like 20’ different companies which is great to hear
Sarah Kim:
  That's really awesome!! I love that you're so good at what you do and that what you do is what you love to do. That's so important and I want my future to look like that 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  :0
  thank you. i want it to look like that too. and i’m sure it will. you have such a head start on me believe it or not
  when I was 22 I had no fucking idea
  you already have a passion and drive and you’re great at what you do
Sarah Kim:
  You know that I'm 21 right 😏
  But thank you. I want to be like you when I grow up 👴👵
  I wantttttt to showerrrrr I feel like I smell like sex 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Hahahaha
  Really you're 21?!
  Wow I'm the worst. Sorry
Sarah Kim:
  Yeah I feel like you should have known am that haha 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Definitely. Well at least you're not 20
  Don't be offended
Sarah Kim:
  Hey what if I was 20! 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  I dunno isn't that illegal?
Sarah Kim:
  Hahaha no the legal age is 18
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Haha
  Ok I'm sorry now I know
Sarah Kim:
  Does it matter that I'm 21? 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  no of course not
  i don’t care about age at all
  
if i looked like 1000x less asian this would be a good one
Sarah Kim:
  I like it! You look like a happy grumpy grampa
  What are you doing this evening 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  hehe. don’t call me grandpa
  dinner with some startup people then i’m freeeeee
  what are you doing? want to do something with me?
Sarah Kim:
  I'm headed home now. I'm probably going to take a nap and make our lunches for tomorrow
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yeeeeey
  it’s going to be so great!
  i’m unreasonably excited about it
Sarah Kim:
  I have some reading to do but other than I've got nothing due tomorrow so I wanna get started on doing some mock ups for the online publication 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  nice!

Sarah Kim:

Fred Stevens-Smith:
  well i’ll be done by like 9.30
  we’re eating really close to my place
  (i would invite you but it’s a founders thing and i kiboshed outsider invites in the past)
Sarah Kim:
  No worries. Let me know when you get home and I'll come over :)
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  i am excite
  also... man we have to fire nick
  i’m a bit 😟 
  we had like a 3 hour meeting where i fought the others on it because i want to keep him
Sarah Kim:
  Oh no
  Why do you have to?
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  basically because he’s not a *good enough* programmer. let’s talk about it later
  by that i mean i would love to talk with you about it later
  😊
Sarah Kim:
  👌
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Yo I'm going home now 
Sarah Kim:
  Hi! I'm an iziot and I didn't put on the rice before I passed out for 2 hours so I'm just starting to cook. It won't take me that long but I feel so cold and tired 😣
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Ahhh noooo
  So - you're not going to be in my bed tonight?
Sarah Kim:
  I think I better stay home tonight. I don't think I'm going to want to take the bus later 
  I want toooo thought
  Though 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  No that makes sense
  Well there's always ubes 💩
  But do whatever you want to love. I'll send an ubes if it's just the bus but if you're tired then maybe you should stay 
Sarah Kim:
  I don't want you to keep having to pay for me! 😣
  I'll see how I feel after I'm done and let you know 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  No stress ✌️
  I miss you

Sarah Kim:
  I miss you too, it's kinda weird for me. But it'll be that much nicer to see each other tomorrow right? 😊

Sarah Kim:

Fred Stevens-Smith:
  And you're right. I am excite about lunch!

Sarah Kim:

  File Transfer: IMG_6276.png

Sarah Kim:
  You woke up like dis 😐

  We have the technology. 
  thank you for lunch sk 😊
  it was very nice
  this afternoon is brutal
Sarah Kim:
  Of course :) I'm glad you enjoyed it
  Yeah this weekend is a bit like that for me too I feel so lethargic and can't focus on anything 
  How's yours going though 
  Afternoon*
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yeah it’s just all work all work can’t wait to relax with you 
  at least its sunny
Sarah Kim:
  I might have to pull an all nighter tonight :( I have a lot more work to do than I thought 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  orly?
  so no sarah for me?
  can i help with anything?
Sarah Kim:
  Well I have to have the issue zero for my publication ready to show tomorrow and I basically have to do a bunch of mockups and I don't know how long that'll take 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  digital or real?
  well do whatever you gotta do love, no stress either way
Sarah Kim:
  I'm doing it on photoshop. Id love your help! Maybe I can do this at yours and you can just go to bed when you need to?
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yes
  !
  only if i’m allowed to 😘 you
Sarah Kim:
  Haha of course 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  in the meantime listen to some t00ns and get that caffeine in
Sarah Kim:
  On it. I'll probably be bouncing off the walls by the time I see you 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  hehe i look forward to it
Sarah Kim:
  I think I want quit my freelance job very soon :(
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  do it
  that sounds like the optimum idea to me
Sarah Kim:
  I think I will. They suck at communicating and I feel like neither party has benefitted hugely from having me work for them. I'm frustrated because they treat me like someone that just knows how to use adobe software 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  plus they don’t give you racks bab
  fuck em
Sarah Kim:
  Yeah plus I'm just not having fun, doing work for them feels like a chore 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  ok we need to get you a good job
Sarah Kim:
  Ahh I am so annoyed right now 😡
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  why? the freelance thing/
  ?
Sarah Kim:
  Yeah. I only communicate with this one woman Eva and she just had me re-do a bunch of shit because she totally fucked up on communicating with me. She's like "Sorry about that, but let me be totally passive aggressive with you"
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  wow what a dick move
Sarah Kim:
  What do I do??
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  let’s talk about it later
  i mean you just need to tell them that you’re bouncing
  and if they’re chill they won’t make you do 30 days notice
Sarah Kim:
  I could probably find someone that'd want to take my place then again I wouldn't anyone I know to be stuck with this shitty job. But yeah let's talk about it later 
  Let's go get dinner? I feel like I need a drink and yummy food 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  yes lets
  7.30 you me red wine
Sarah Kim:
  Where do you want to eat? 
  Nothing too pricey plz!
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  my treat
  i just got paiiiiid
  what kind of thing are you hungry for
  i could eat american
  there’s a cute place near me
Sarah Kim:
  I could eat anything! You get to choose

Sarah Kim:
  Got home a little bit ago. I'm going to leave in like 10 minutes 
  What's up with you 
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  Ok
Sarah Kim:
  If I'm going straight to yours, should I just go get the equipment from school and meet you there? Or would that interfere with Russell's plans
Fred Stevens-Smith:
  No that would definitely work 
  Either eat
  Way*
Sarah Kim:
  Okay I'll über to yours from school. I'll let you know when I'm leaving 
  Are you ready to dip or should I give you more time ?
Fred Stevens-Smith:

Sarah Kim:
